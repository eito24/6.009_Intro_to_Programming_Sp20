# [6.009](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=6.009) (Fundamentals of Programming Spring 2020)

Introduces fundamental concepts of programming. Designed to develop skills in applying basic methods from programming languages to abstract problems. Topics include programming and Python basics, computational concepts, software engineering, algorithmic techniques, data types, and recursion. Lab component consists of software design and implementation. </br>

</br>
The Focus of the Class:</br>
- programming: analyzing and decomposing problems, developing plans</br>
- coding: translating those plans into correct, efficient, idiomatic, understandable Python code</br>
- debugging: developing test cases, verifying correctness, and finding and fixing the errors that inevitably happen</br>
</br>
Topics Covered:</br>
- high-level design strategies</br>
- ways of managing complexity</br>
- details and advanced features and "goodies" of Python</br>
- a mental model of Python's operation</br>
- testing and debugging strategies</br>
and more
